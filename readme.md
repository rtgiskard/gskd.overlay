# Gentoo overlay of giskard

A [Gentoo overlay][] with some tools, updates, new packages and
paches not yet in the Gentoo tree.

most of the ebuilds are based on existing one and the references
should be listed in the ebuild file. And the packages is not fully
tested to work completely fine, while it should at least compile
and work here.
