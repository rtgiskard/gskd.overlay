# Gentoo overlay of giskard

A [Gentoo overlay][] with some tools, updates, new packages and
paches not yet in the Gentoo tree.

most of the ebuilds are based on existing one with the references
listed in the ebuild file. And the packages is not fully tested to
work totally fine, while it should at least compile and works.

If anyone would like to merge any of the ebuild into the official repo,
it will be appreciated a lot! I'm sorry for not be able to do that in a
reasonable time, so just feel free to do that if you want.
